# ThreeBody_Problem
This repository is based on the final project I did for my Computational Physics class. The project is an adaptation on the Three Body Problem  focusing on the problem found by Burrau( 1913), and the general solution made by Szebehely and Peters (1967). The goal of the project was to replicate the motion of the orbits from the three bodies on the Szebehely and Peters original paper. The motion of the orbits was achieved by using Python as the progamming language, and then write the paper in LaTeX using Overleaf.
